# WordSense-Embedder

## Description
WordSense-Embedder is a robust implementation of the skip-gram model using negative sampling to generate and manipulate word embeddings. This project facilitates the exploration of semantic relationships in textual data, and includes functionalities for text normalization, model training, saving, and loading models, as well as evaluating semantic accuracy through analogy tests.

## Features
- **Text Normalization**: Clean and prepare text data for processing.
- **Model Training**: Train word embedding models using the skip-gram architecture with options for negative sampling.
- **Persistence**: Save and load trained models using Python's pickle module.
- **Semantic Testing**: Evaluate model performance with analogy and similarity tests.
